The data type that stores one of two possible values (True or False) is called boolean.

You can use booleans when filtering data.

The result of a comparison operation is always a boolean. The boolean values are used to filter the data.

Example:

/*Creates a table with the movies that
haven't won an Oscar*/
SELECT  id, title, is_oscar_winner
FROM movies
WHERE is_oscar_winner = False;
