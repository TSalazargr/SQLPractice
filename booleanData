The data type that stores one of two possible values (True or False) is called boolean.

You can use booleans when filtering data.

The result of a comparison operation is always a boolean. The boolean values are used to filter the data.

Booleans help you write more complex and effective queries to answer questions about the data. 

Operations involving boolean values are known as logical operations.

A logical operation takes several boolean values to produce a boolean value.

Example:

/*Creates a table with the movies that
haven't won an Oscar*/
SELECT  id, title, is_oscar_winner
FROM movies
WHERE is_oscar_winner = False;
