<h2>Select</h2>
  <p>The SELECT command is used to extract field data from a tableâ€¤</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>SELECT year</br>
    FROM movies</p>
<h2>Order numerically</h2>
  <p>Sorting consists of putting data in a meaningful order.</p>
  <p>The ORDER BY command is used to sort the extracted data in the results table. Data is sorted by fields.</p>
  <p>Your extracted data will be sorted in ascending order by default. If you need the data sorted in descending order (from largest to smallest) you need to add the DESC keyword.</p>
  <p>By default, data is sorted in ascending order. You can use the explicit ASC keyword to clarify and make your queries more readable, particularly when writing complex queries.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>SELECT *<br>
    FROM movies<br>
    ORDER BY year</p>
    <p>SELECT *<br>
    FROM customers<br>
    ORDER BY age DESC</p>
<h2>Order alphabetically</h2>
  <p>You can also sort data by a field that contains text. The default ascending order for text is alphabetical order.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>SELECT *<br>
    FROM customers<br>
    ORDER BY name DESC</p>
<h2>Limit</h2>
  <p>Breaking large sets of data into smaller parts speeds up loading times and helps show people only what they need.</p>
  <p>The LIMIT keyword extracts a limited number of records.</p>
  <p>LIMIT can be used combined with ORDER BY. LIMIT is applied as the last operation. The results will be sorted first, then limited.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>--Extracts the first 10 records<br>
      SELECT *<br>
      FROM employees<br>
      LIMIT 10</p>

    <p>--Extracts the first 10 lowestrecords<br>
      SELECT *<br>
      FROM employees<br>
      ORDER BY salary ASC<br>
      LIMIT 10</p>
<h2>Offset</h2>
  <p>The OFFSET parameter is used with LIMIT to skip a number of records.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>--Skips 2 first records<br>
      SELECT title<br>
      FROM movies<br>
      LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2</p>

<h2>As</h2>

You can give columns a temporary name (or alias) using the AS keyword
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>--Create a table with the name and price x delivery; name the new field 'multiplication'
  SELECT name, price*delivery AS multiplication<br>
  FROM sales</p>
