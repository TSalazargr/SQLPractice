<h2>Select</h2>
  <p>The SELECT command is used to extract field data from a tableâ€¤</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>SELECT year</br>
    FROM movies</p>
<h2>Order numerically</h2>
  <p>Sorting consists of putting data in a meaningful order.</p>
  <p>The ORDER BY command is used to sort the extracted data in the results table. Data is sorted by fields.</p>
  <p>Your extracted data will be sorted in ascending order by default. If you need the data sorted in descending order (from largest to smallest) you need to add the DESC keyword.</p>
  <p>By default, data is sorted in ascending order. You can use the explicit ASC keyword to clarify and make your queries more readable, particularly when writing complex queries.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>SELECT *<br>
    FROM movies<br>
    ORDER BY year</p>
    <p>SELECT *<br>
    FROM customers<br>
    ORDER BY age DESC</p>
<h2>Order alphabetically</h2>
  <p>You can also sort data by a field that contains text. The default ascending order for text is alphabetical order.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>SELECT *<br>
    FROM customers<br>
    ORDER BY name DESC</p>
<h2>Limit</h2>
  <p>Breaking large sets of data into smaller parts speeds up loading times and helps show people only what they need.</p>
  <p>The LIMIT keyword extracts a limited number of records.</p>
  <p>LIMIT can be used combined with ORDER BY. LIMIT is applied as the last operation. The results will be sorted first, then limited.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>--Extracts the first 10 records<br>
      SELECT *<br>
      FROM employees<br>
      LIMIT 10</p>

    <p>--Extracts the first 10 lowestrecords<br>
      SELECT *<br>
      FROM employees<br>
      ORDER BY salary ASC<br>
      LIMIT 10</p>
<h2>Offset</h2>
  <p>The OFFSET parameter is used with LIMIT to skip a number of records.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>--Skips 2 first records<br>
      SELECT title<br>
      FROM movies<br>
      LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2</p>

<h2>As</h2>

<p>You can give columns a temporary name (or alias) using the AS keyword</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>--Create a table with the name and price x delivery; name the new field 'multiplication'
  SELECT name, price*delivery AS multiplication<br>
  FROM sales</p>

<h2>Where and Comparison operations</h2>

<p>WHERE is used to extract records that meet a condition.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>SELECT *<br>
FROM studio<br>
WHERE name = 'Walt Disney'</p>

<p>Strings (text values) have to be surrounded by single quotes (').</p>

<p>SELECT *<br>
FROM studio<br>
WHERE year_funded > 2000</p>

<p>SELECT *<br>
FROM studio<br>
WHERE year_funded = 2000</p>

<h2>Like</h2>

<p>The LIKE keyword is used with the WHERE command to search for patterns in string values.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>SELECT *<br>
FROM comics<br>
WHERE title LIKE 'The Avengers%'</p>

<p>A comparison operation always results in one of these two outcomes: Yes (True) or No (False)</p>

<h2>Multiple Queries</h2>
<pYou can include multiple queries in your SQL code. You just need to separate them with a semicolon(;)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>/*Generates two tables: one with fields name and code extracted from products<br>
and one with all the names of the records where the field code has the structure A_B_<br>
SELECT name, code<br>
FROM products;<br>
<br>
SELECT name<br>
FROM products<br>
WHERE code LIKE 'A_B_';</p>

<h2>Wildcards</h2>

<h3>%</h3>
<p>The % symbol can replace any number of characters (one, multiple or none) in a string to create patterns. The % special symbol is known as a wildcard and is used to create patterns.</p> 
<p>Patterns with the LIKE operator are case-sensitive in most database systems. This means that the pattern will treat uppercase and lowercase characters as different.</P>
<p>When numbers are part of a string they can also be matched with patterns.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>You can use patterns to extract email addresses that share the same domain.</p>
<p>%gmail.com' will extract any email that ends with 'gmail.com'</p>

<h3>_</h3>

<p>The underscore symbol _ is another wildcard and represents 1 single character only.</p>

<h2>Lower and Uppercase</h2>

<p>Patterns are case-sensitive. <br>

LOWER() and UPPER() commands are used to convert strings to lower or uppercase.</p>

<p>Use LOWER (or UPPER) with LIKE in the WHERE command line for case-insensitive pattern matching</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>SELECT LOWER(title)<br>
FROM movies;<br>
SELECT UPPER(title)<br>
FROM movies;</p>

<p>/*Transform everything to lowercase for case-insensitive pattern matching<br>
The lowercase transformation only affects the WHERE, the table itself would preserve the original format*/
SELECT title<br>
FROM books<br>
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%cooking%'</p>
