Raw (or untreated) data needs to be processed and analyzed so it can be used to make decisions. This process involves different steps.

In this lesson, you'll learn about the first steps in the data analysis process, starting with questions.

Some questions can be answered with a filtering query.

Example:

  SELECT name
  FROM students
  WHERE grade = 100

A lot of data lives on the Internet. Servers are computers that are always listening for requests of information.
You can request information from a database server through an API (Application Programming Interface).

There are APIs to request data from Facebook, Youtube, Wikipedia and pretty much every other platform.

There is a vast ocean of information on the web. Web scraping allows you to extract information from websites. 

Some knowledge of HTML and a programming language like Python will help you extract information you need from the internet.
