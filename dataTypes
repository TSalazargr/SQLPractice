A data table is filled with values. There are different types of values, such as numeric values and text values.

Numberic values

  Numeric values: you can do calculations with SQL with them<

    SELECT name, price*delivery
    FROM sales

  You can give these new fields an alias with AS

    SELECT name, price+delivery AS total
    FROM sales

Text Values

    A piece of text data is technically called a STRING. An operation that you can do with strings is concatenation.

    Concatenation joins strings together.

      SELECT CONCAT(first_name, last_name) AS full_name
      FROM employees
